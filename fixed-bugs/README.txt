This directory contains patches that should be fed back to SGI for
inclusion in GLU proper.

Note that no fixes that were made before 2003-11-19 has been recorded
here. So someone should track down all older fixes from the CVS logs,
and collect them into patches (with proper problem descriptions for
the SGI maintainer(s) of GLU to peruse).
